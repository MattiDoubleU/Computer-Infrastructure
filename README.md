The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my skills and progress in the following areas:

- Utilizing, configuring, and scripting within a command line interface environment.
- Managing and transferring data and code through command line operations.
- Comparing different software infrastructures and architectures.
- Choosing the appropriate infrastructure for specific computational tasks.

## Installation, Usage, and Dependencies:
